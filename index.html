          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="lead">My name is Anthony DelPercio, and I am a 4th year college student, currently in my second year at Coastal Carolina University. I am a Digital Culture and Design major here after completing my first 2 years at West Virginia University in Sport Psychology. Currently, I am interested in going deeper into even more fields to see what exactly it is I want to do with my life. Afterall, how do you know you want to do something, if you’ve never done it? So, in my life right now I am in the process of finding that one “thing” that makes me happy and can also make me money. I’m very interested in working on team-oriented jobs and tasks. I do well working with other people and working in social settings on my feet moving around. I’m inspired in all fields, by my mother. She raised 3 kids by herself as an elementary level teacher and still managed to spend more than enough time with us as a family. I hope to one day find something that makes me as happy as teaching makes her. After all, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life! My career aspirations are to make a difference. Although this sounds very cliché and broad, it has deeper meaning behind it. I aspire to do something with my career that directly impacts the lives of other people to make a difference in their life. There are obviously many fields this can be accomplished in and that’s the part I don’t quite have figured out yet. The idea of sitting behind a desk on a computer all day does not motivate me at all. I aspire to be around people, to be helping people, and ultimately, to be working together with people to accomplish one common task at hand. I aspire to make a living that allows me to provide for my family as well. I would love to one day give back to my mother, what seems like half, of what she gave to me.</p>

          <h2>My Aesthetic</h2>
          <p class="lead">For me, life is about color. We don’t all have the gift of seeing color, so those who do, should take full advantage. This leads me to believe why my aesthetic is so bright! I prefer colorful work, I like all colors, but I take more to brighter or pastel hue’s than I do monotone or warm hues. I love nature as well, which plays a huge role in my aesthetic. I love work that has to do with nature, this includes the natural human body, animals, the beach, a rainforest, and earth, fire and water as well. I’m always drawn to realism, things that can actually be captured in real time or drawling’s that are a biproduct of a real event. I like simplicity but complex works don’t turn me off completely. Sometimes certain things are made to be more complex, and that’s okay. I also have a very specific aesthetic that appeals to me the most, the beach. Anything, whether it be a picture, a drawling, a film., anything that has the beach in it, you can count me in. I’ve always been drawn to the water, and the beach to me is the most beautiful, chaotic, serene, complex place in the world!</p>
